# Line-coding-encoder-and-scrambler

Program generates random binary stream or data with sequences (based on userâ€™s input). Additionally, it generates
longest palindrome. We get output as per the encoding scheme chosen by user. Available encoding schemes are
NRZ-L,NRZ-I,MANCHESTER,DIFFERENTIAL MANCHESTER,AMI(with B8ZS AND HDB3 scrambling
schemes).
Language used: C++;
Libraries used:
1)#include<bits/stdc++.h>
Includes all the standard library.
2)#include<graphics.h>
Provides access to a graphics library that makes it possible for us to create diagrams.
Assumptions considered:
1)We are using GE Thomas representation of Manchester encoding scheme.
2)Positive logic encoding scheme considered.

How to run the code:
1)Create project.
2)Write the code.
3)Use TDM-GCC 4.9.2 32-bit release.
4)Compile and run.
